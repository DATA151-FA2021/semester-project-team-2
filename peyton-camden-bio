Peyton Camden's Bio

Name: Peyton Camden
Major: Meteorology
Minor: Math
Year in School: 3rd year junior

Key skills you bring to the group: I know a bit (see: I took an intro coding class during covid semester) about python already, but am not very confident in my skills specifically
in coding. I'm pretty alright at googling, and I'm not afraid to ask questions. Other fun skills include the ability to do a headstand and a high pain tolerance (those two are
related).
