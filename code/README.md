# Project Code

Use this as reference for what each code sheet was used for.

Backwards Regression Model.R: R code for backwards elimination to find variables that we would use using "Weightless_Numerical_Data.csv" data.

Creating dummies sheet: Used previously to create dummy variables for out yes no variables as well as the other categorical variables.

Decision Tree: Used to test decision tree models using "Numerical_data.csv".

Demo Code.ipynb: This is the final version of our code for this project which includes the cleaning used. Uses "Python_Weightless_Numerical_Data.csv" for modeling.

In_Class_Work_11_4.ipynb: More attempts at models with "Numerical_data.csv".

Modeling 11_11_21.ipynb: Modeling attempts with "Numercal_data(No Zero).csv".

Modeling Part 4: Some of our later modeling towards the end of our project, uses both "Cleaned_Weightless_Numerical_Data.csv" and "Numerical_data(No Zero).csv".

Modelling_Part_3.ipynb: More modeling attempts with "Numerical_data(No Zero).csv".

RScript for Backwards Linear Regression.docx: A word file showing the original backwards elimination in R using "Numerical_data.csv"

Semester_Project_Part_2_Code_Graphs_Added.ipynb: Original code with cleaning and data analysis, uses "LasVegasTripAdvisorReviews-Dataset.csv".
